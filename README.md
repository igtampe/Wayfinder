# Wayfinder
This programs finds routes between waypoints. It's mostly some recursion practice for myself.

It's currently pre-loaded with waypoints for the UMS (A minecraft server I administrate).

We use KeyManager and MouseManager from AlexVR's engine. All credits to him for that part of this project.
